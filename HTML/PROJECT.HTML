                <p> Eradicating poverty in all its forms remains one of the greatest challenges facing humanity.
                    <br> While the number of people living in extreme poverty dropped by more than half between 1990 and
                    2015,
                    <br> too many are still struggling for the most basic human needs.

                <h2>SDG GOLE 2 [Zero hunger]</h2>
                <p>The number of undernourished people has dropped by almost half in the past two decades because of
                    rapid
                    economic
                    growth and increased agricultural productivity.
                    <br>Many developing countries that used to suffer from famine and hunger can now meet their
                    nutritional
                    needs.
                    <br> Central and East Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean have all made huge progress in
                    eradicating
                    extreme
                    hunger.

                <p>Not only does disease impact the well being of an individual, it burdens family and public resources,
                    weakens
                    societies, and squanders potential.
                    <br> The health and well being of people at all ages therefore lies at the heart of sustainable
                    development.
                    <br>Protection from disease is not only fundamental to survival, but it enables opportunity for
                    everyone
                    and
                    strengthens economic growth and prosperity.

                <p>Since 2000, there has been enormous progress in achieving the target of universal primary education.
                    <br>The total enrolment rate in developing regions reached 91 percent in 2015,
                    <br>and the worldwide number of children out of school has dropped by almost half.
                    <br>There has also been a dramatic increase in literacy rates, and many more girls
                    <br>are in school than ever before. These are all remarkable successes.

                    <br> Ending all forms of discrimination against women and girls is not only a basic human right, but
                    it
                    <br> also has a multiplier effect across all other development areas.
